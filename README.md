# Hello :wave:
Hello, I'm Sam/Shock59! I'm currently in high school in Australia and haven't made any notable contributions or projects yet, maybe I will maybe I won't. For now I just do random JavaScript projects and other random stuff which I sometimes post here.

I'm not active on any public socials other than my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@shock59/) and this GitHub account, and don't yet have a public email - I will update this if that ever changes.

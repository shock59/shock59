# Hello :wave:

Hello, I'm Sam/Shock59! I'm currently in high school in Australia and haven't made any notable contributions or projects yet, maybe I will maybe I won't. For now I just do random JavaScript, TypeScript and game development projects and other random stuff which I sometimes post here.

I'm not active on any public socials other than my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@shock59/) and this GitHub account, I will update this if that ever changes. If you need to contact me, you can do so by emailing [shock59@proton.me](mailto:shock59@proton.me).

I live in Australia and my timezone is AEST (UTC+10), or AEDT in daylight savings (UTC+11). I use any pronouns.
